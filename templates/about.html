            Colorize Beyond is the web app based on a deep learning image-to-image translation implementated by Jun-Yan Zhu. The core feature of this web app allows user to upload and colorize grayscale pictures using a pre-trained deep learning pix2pix model. More advanced users can upload their own datasets and a backend worker will train models for them. Trained models can be used from web UI or via an HTTP API.
            <br/>
            This app was developed as a graduation project for Hackbright Academy by engineering student Hanna Babushkina.
