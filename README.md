Colorize Beyond
===
**Deep learning pix2pix API**

The basic feature of this web app allows you to upload and
colorize grayscale pictures using a pre-trained deep learning pix2pix model
based on PyTorch implementation by Jun-Yan Zhu. More advanced users can upload
their own datasets and a backend worker will train models for them.
Trained models can be used from web UI or via an HTTP API.
